# Visualizing Investment Portfolio Trends and Asset Allocation with MAUI Toolkit Charts

This sample demonstrates how to create a MAUI chart using [Pie Series](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-circular-charts/maui-pie-chart), [Line Series](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts/maui-line-chart), and [Column Series](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts/maui-column-chart) with [SfCartesianChart](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-cartesian-charts) and [SfCircularChart](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-circular-charts) to analyze investment portfolio distribution, performance trends, and asset allocation over different years.

Investment portfolios consist of various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, and cash, each contributing to overall financial stability. By visualizing these asset allocations effectively, investors can make informed decisions based on historical trends and market conditions.
